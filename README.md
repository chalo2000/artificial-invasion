# Artificial Invasion (AI)

To start playing, create a user and make a character on it. Once you've done so, you can battle AI by creating a battle with yourself as the challenger, or you can make a battle request to another user's character.

When battling, you can Attack, Defend, or Counter. Two battlers that Attack both take damage, but you can halve the damage taken if you Defend. You can avoid taking damage completely by using Counter, dealing double damage to your opponent, but if they Defend then they'll avoid full damage while you take normal damage.

You can also create and end friendships!

## Future Features
- Authentication so only logged in users can make data modifying requests to their characters, requests, and battles
- Receiving email notifications using Sendgrid whenever receiving a request and upon completing a battle.
- Getting random AI and character images (using RoboHash) and storing them as profile pictures (AWS storage)
- An actual UI
